# Deshaker
Deshaker is a video stabilizer for VirtualDub. Binaries as well as information about using it can be found at https://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm.
# How to build
The code is a Visual Studio 2022 C++ project. Community edition works fine. In the Visual Studio setup you should include "Desktop Development with C++" and also MFC as an individual component.
